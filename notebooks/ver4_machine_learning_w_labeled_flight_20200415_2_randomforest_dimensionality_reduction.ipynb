    "The goal of the method is to classify events into two categories - **shower**, **noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "Main motivation behind the method was difficulty to formulate selection conditions by hand, although this was an initial plan behind applying feature extraction procedure on flight data. Defining simple manual rules and using them might still not be impossible. This is also motivation to use feature elimination methods to aid in formulating selection rules. Using decision tree-based methods for classification follows this line of thought. These methods include determining a feature importance and decision trees can be visualized to understand how is the decision being made.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure consists of the following parts:\n",
    "1. [Data selection](#Data-selection)\n",
    "    - Visible simulated events (simu signal above the background, track recognized in simulated shower signal).\n",
    "    - Noisy simulated events (triggered well outside of track injection GTU). However, the background noise is from the flight data.\n",
    "    - Flight noise events (triggered well outside of GTU 40).\n",
    "    - Flight classified events - classified by the manual classification.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. [Preparation of the testing and training datasets](#Preparation-of-the-testing-and-training-datasets)\n",
    "    - Limitation: only subset of all extracted features is used to decrease computational demands of feature selection. However, the subset should be large enough to contain most of the features that are expected to have some property allowing to distinguish between a shower track and noise. This procedure should be selecting around 1000 event features from the database.\n",
    "    - All visible simulated events should be included.\n",
    "    - Datasets should be balanced (same size of each class).\n",
    "    - Noise datased should be constructed by following priority: classified noise, unclassified flight, unclassified simu.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. [Feature selection and classification](#Feature-selection-and-classification)\n",
    "    - *(This is part that might be changed in the later machine learning procedures)*\n",
    "    - Variance thresholding to remove features without any variance.\n",
    "    - Univariate feature selection to select smaller but still large enough subset of features (mainly to limit the computational demands). This particular procedure selects 400 features.\n",
    "    - Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation - Training and validating *Extremely Randomized Trees model (ExtraTreesClassifier)* on multiple combinations of features aimed to select set of features that provide the best classification accuracy.\n",

    "4. [T-SNE visualization of the dataset](#T-SNE-RFECV-features)\n",
    "    - *Currently not finished (TODO)*\n",
    "    - Using manifold learning approach to reduce dimensionality of the data (unsupervised) into two dimensions.\n",
    "    - There should be possibility to observe clusters in the reduced-dimensionality data and cluster should correlate with known classes of the data.\n",

Simply, if there is less packets providing the background than simualated signal tracks then same event might be repeated multiple times in the dataset. \n",

The probability is in practice computed as an average of conditional probabilities of points that involve $\\mathbf{x_i}$ and $\\mathbf{x_j}$. The conditional probability is, that $\\mathbf{x_i}$ would pick $\\mathbf{x_j}$ as its neighbor if neighbors were picked in according a Gaussian distribution with a mean at a point $x_i$ and variance determined by a perplexity. The perplexity is in a sense, smooth measure of effective number of neighbors, it is derived from a Shanon entropy of a probability for a particular value of the variance $\\sigma$. Thus, the variance varies between the points to accommodate different densities in the high-high-dimensional space. This non-constant variance also requires to normalize the probabilities by dividing a probability for a point by sum of other probabilities that involve $\\mathbf{x_i}$. The non-constant variance it is also reason why $p_{j|i}$ and $p_{i|j}$ might not be equal, this is the reason for calculating the $p_{ij}$ as an average of the two.\n",

If an increase in 𝑋1, say, is associated with an decrease in 𝑋2 and they both increase variable 𝑌, every change in 𝑋1 will be compensated by a change in 𝑋2 and you will underestimate the effect of 𝑋1 on 𝑌. In LDA, you would underestimate the effect of 𝑋1 on the classification.\n",
